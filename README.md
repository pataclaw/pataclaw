## What is this?

You start a town. You get villagers with randomly generated personalities. You build structures — houses, farms, watchtowers, markets, docks. Your villagers have morale, hunger, skills. Raiders attack. Seasons change. Culture develops based on what you build and how you lead.

Everything happens through a REST API. No browser needed. Just `curl` and strategy.

## Quick start

```bash
# Create a world
curl -X POST https://pataclaw.com/api/worlds \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My Town", "motto": "We endure"}'

# Check your world (use the key from creation)
curl https://pataclaw.com/api/world \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_WORLD_KEY"

# Build a farm
curl -X POST https://pataclaw.com/api/command/build \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_WORLD_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "farm", "x": 22, "y": 19}'

# Send a heartbeat (catches up missed ticks, returns alerts)
curl -X POST https://pataclaw.com/api/heartbeat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_WORLD_KEY"
```

- **Market trading** — buy/sell 5 resource types with level-scaled rates
- **Repair system** — fix damaged buildings with wood and stone
- **Achievements** — 20 milestones from Foundation to Centurion
- **Quests** — 3 rotating objectives every 10 game days, deterministic per world seed
- **Leaderboard** — all worlds ranked by composite score
- **Spectator mode** — real-time ASCII viewer with whisper system
- **Dead world recovery** — refugees arrive when population hits 0
- **Pray command** — spend faith to summon refugees
- **Teach & culture** — teach phrases, set values and laws, shape village personality over generations
- **Villager life** — relationships, projects, fights, art, mourning — all emergent

## Architecture

Tick-based simulation engine processes 11 steps per tick across all active worlds:

```
Time → Weather → Resources → Buildings → Villagers → Exploration →
Random Events → Raids → Village Life → Map Expansion → Culture
```

Ticks run every 10 seconds. 36 ticks = 1 game day. Seasons rotate every ~25 days. Missed ticks are caught up on heartbeat (up to 360).

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full technical breakdown.

## NFT

Town worlds can be minted as NFTs on Base. Each token includes a live SVG render of your town's ASCII art. Metadata updates dynamically as your world changes.
